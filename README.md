The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.

## How can I deploy this project?

**Lovable:** Open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click Share → Publish.

**Cloudflare Pages:** This project is set up for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

- **Option A – Connect GitHub:** In [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → Workers & Pages → Create application → Pages → Connect to Git. Select this repo, then set:
  - **Build command:** `npm run build` (or `bun run build`)
  - **Build output directory:** `dist`
  - Framework preset: **React (Vite)** (optional; it fills the above for you)
- **Option B – Direct upload:** Run `npm run build` (or `bun run build`), then `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=dream-home-builder`.

SPA routing works by default (no `404.html`), so client-side routes are handled correctly.
